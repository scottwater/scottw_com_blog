This is the personal blog of Scott Watermasysk. 

It is built with Jekyll and is currently hosted on Heroku with the help of Rack-Jekyll*.

Building this site was made possible by the awesomeness of Jekyll and following folks for posting their Jekyll sites to Github:

J
A
T

At times it might be hard to see it in my mangled markup, but I borrowed pits and pieces form each of their sites to make this work.

All the content/etc is released under Creative Commons. I do ask that you don't repost verbatim and in the event you too want a drab looking site, feel free to fork it. :)
