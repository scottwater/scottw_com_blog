h1. About

This is the personal blog of [Scott Watermasysk](http://scottw.com). 

It is built with "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com and is currently hosted on "Heroku":http://heroku.com with the help of "Rack-Jekyll":http://github.com/bry4n/rack-jekyll.

Building this site was made possible by the awesomeness of Jekyll and following folks for posting their Jekyll sites to Github:

* "John Duff":http://jduff.github.com/ ("github":http://github.com/jduff/jduff.github.com)
* "Alex Payne":http://al3x.net/) ("github":http://github.com/al3x/al3x.github.com)
* "Tate Johnson":http://tatey.com) ("github":http://github.com/tatey/tatey.com)

At times it might be hard to see it in my mangled markup, but I borrowed pits and pieces form each of their sites to make this work.

All the content/etc is released under Creative Commons. I do ask that you don't repost verbatim and in the event you too want a drab looking site, feel free to fork it. :)
