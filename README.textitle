This is the personal blog of [Scott Watermasysk](http://scottw.com). 

It is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is currently hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) with the help of [Rack-Jekyll](http://github.com/bry4n/rack-jekyll).

Building this site was made possible by the awesomeness of Jekyll and following folks for posting their Jekyll sites to Github:

* [John Duff](http://jduff.github.com/) ([github](http://github.com/jduff/jduff.github.com))
* [Alex Payne](http://al3x.net/) ([github](http://github.com/al3x/al3x.github.com))
* [Tate Johnson](http://tatey.com) ([github](http://github.com/tatey/tatey.com))

At times it might be hard to see it in my mangled markup, but I borrowed pits and pieces form each of their sites to make this work.

All the content/etc is released under Creative Commons. I do ask that you don't repost verbatim and in the event you too want a drab looking site, feel free to fork it. :)
