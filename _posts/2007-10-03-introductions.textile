OK, some of you maybe thinking, hey don't you already have a blog? Well, yes I do and thanks for noticing. :)

I have been blogging on "ScottWater.com":http://scottwater.com for nearly 5 years and during that time I have learned a lot and even more has changed. I felt it was time to move on start fresh. This of course means leaving behind a nice Google Rank and quite a few posts. I have been thinking about doing this for quite a while and even started something similar for a little a year or so ago. You get very few chances in life to start something over. For me, it was time.

So what is going to change? Over the last 5 years I have written primarily about .NET, .Text, and Community Server. Except for .Text, I still plan on covering .NET and Community Server hear as well. However, what I would like to focus more on is what I learned about build a great product and team, working for a dynamic growing company, and the quest to more simplify my life/software.

In terms of content, I am going to try to focus on both shorter and longer pieces. In the past I have often tried to stay somewhere in the middle. The problem with this is life can sometimes get in the way (often a good thing) and nothing ever gets published. On Simpable, I am going to try to post some quickies pretty often and give myself plenty of time to post some of the longer pieces I have been scribbling notes about for years.

Once I get the kinks worked on the new site, I will probably redirect the scottwater.com feed to the new Simpable one, but in the mean time, if you want to stay up to date, please subscribe to my need "RSS Feed":http://scottw.com/feed/.
