It is hard to believe that today marks my five year "anniversary at Telligent":http://scottw.com/life/telligentsystems/. Next to my wife, this is by far my longest relationship that I was not born into.

The thing I really like the most about Telligent is constant desire to improve everything.

There have numerous times over the past five years where things started to get comfortable and then we realize good for today just won't cut it tomorrow. This kind of environment isn't for everyone, but for me, it fits perfectly.

As with anything in life doing, there have been some challenges, but overall, it has been a great time and I sincerely hope I get the opportunity to do another one of these posts in 5 years as well.
