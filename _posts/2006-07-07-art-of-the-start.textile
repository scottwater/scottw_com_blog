One of the better books I have read in recent months is "Guy Kawasaki's":http://blog.guykawasaki.com _"The Art of the Start":http://scottwater.com/r.ashx?9_. Although the book is generally about start ups, there is a ton of very sound and practical advice.

I still recommend picking up a copy of the book, but if you are short on time, you can now watch Kawasaki do a "presentation":http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/06/the_art_of_the_.html on many of the topics from the book.
