I just saw a commercial for the "Uniball 207":http://www.uniball-na.com/main.taf?p=2,2,3 which claims it can help prevent check fraud by "Helps prevent check washing". I am not big on the pen market (ok, I actually know nothing except Mont Blanc's are expensive), but this is an interesting pen marketing technique (fear).

It sounds like a "rather nice pen":http://www.moleskinerie.com/2006/06/pen_review_unib.html.
