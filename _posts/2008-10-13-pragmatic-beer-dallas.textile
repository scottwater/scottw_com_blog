The "Pragmatic Beer":http://scottw.com/code/pragmatic-beer/ event we had last week in New Brunswick was a lot of fun. I am going to be in Dallas for "in.Telligent":http://in.telligent.com next week, so I figured it would be a good time to take the show on the road.

When: Wednesday October 22nd at 6:30 PM (CST).
Where: "The Flying Saucer":http://www.beerknurd.com/stores/addison, 
14999 Montfort Drive,
