We ("Telligent":http://telligent.com) have used "Lucene.Net":http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/ quite a bit over the last couple of years. We are getting ready to start on a pretty ambitious update using Lucene.Net and we are hoping to add someone to the team who has expertise in this area.

Similar to some of the "other positions I have posted":http://scottw.com/code/senior-developer-positions/ this one can be fulfilled remotely if you are the right candidate.

Here is a quick run down:

* Full time or contract (although this will be ongoing work, so we prefer FT)
* We prefer Lucene.Net experience, but if you really know "Lucene":http://lucene.apache.org/java/ and have a desire/willingness to jump to the .NET side of the world let us know.
* You must legally be employable in the US (generally this means you must be a US citizen).
* If you lived in the Dallas Texas area that would be ideal, but again if you have skills and a decent internet connection we can make this work.

If you are interested, please send your resume and summary of skills to "scottw@telligent.com":mailto:scottw@telligent.com.
