I have been searching around for an application which manages resumes and interviews, but I have not been able to find one. Here is what I am looking for.

# Resume is submitted to HR (email, form, etc)
# Resume and other information is added to the "Application". This generates a Url which represents the candidate.
# One or more people are selected to interview the candidate. Only the administrator and those selected to interview the candidate can see his/her resume and other information.
# Interview responses/notes are stored with the other candidate information.

Bonus points if other private (such as salary requests and references) can be stored with the resume information but are only viewable to administrators.

I didn't expect to find 100's of applications to choose from, but I did expect this problem to already be solved.

Anyone have any recommendations?
