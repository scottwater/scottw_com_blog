"Jim Nakashima":http://blogs.msdn.com/jnak/ has updated his "ASP.Net MVC Projects running on Windows Azure":http://blogs.msdn.com/jnak/archive/2008/10/28/asp-net-mvc-projects-running-on-windows-azure.aspx post to support "ASP.Net MVC RC 2":http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ee4b2e97-8a72-449a-82d2-2f720d421031&amp;displaylang=en.

Hopefully, this becomes an out of the box project template in the near future. IMO, the type of developers and projects which will be the first to move to the cloud are likely the same group who will be interested first in using MVC.
