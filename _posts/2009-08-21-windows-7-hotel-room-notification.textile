I have been slumming it this week in Hawaii working with a "Telligent Community":http://telligent.com/products/telligent-community/ customer.

This morning, a new (to me?) feature of Windows 7 caught my eye.

Like most hotels, the one I am staying in requires you enable internet access daily. The message above is essentially telling me that while I appear to be connected to the internet, I probably need to take some kind of action if I want to actually do something.

This is a subtle feature, but definitely a nice touch.
