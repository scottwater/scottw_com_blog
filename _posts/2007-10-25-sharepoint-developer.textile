We have a brand new Web Service stack we will be shipping with Community Server 2008. This should enable a couple interesting scenarios:

# It will now be super easy to write tools which work with Community Server with no knowledge of our product internal.
# It will now be very easy to integrate Community Server with a variety of other tools and applications, such as SharePoint.

If you have first hand experience in writing web parts/add-ons for SharePoint, we would love to chat with you about a position on the "Telligent":http://telligent.com/ product team.

Please note the following requirements:

* You must be a U.S. citizen
* It would be great if you were in the Dallas area, but for the right person remote candidates will be considered.
* You MUST have real development experience with SharePoint.
* Seriously, you must have prior experience writing code for SharePoint.

If you meet the requirements above, please send me a copy of your resume at "scottw@telligent.com":mailto:scottw@telligent.com. To be considered, *your email must clearly state your previous SharePoint experience, why you would want the position and include salary expectations*.
