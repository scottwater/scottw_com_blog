<P>As <A href="http://donxml.com" target=_blank>Don</A> <A
href="http://donxml.com/allthingstechie/archive/2004/09/28/1370.aspx"
target=_blank>pointed out</A>, I was recently appointed the <A

Regional Director</A> for New Jersey.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>Regional Directors aren't Microsoft employees--they're independent
developers, architects, trainers, and other professionals who provide a vital
link between Microsoft and the developer community. These technical experts
can give you the insight and informed perspective you need to start developing
.NET-connected software today--whether you need help learning about the .NET
Framework, training developers, or implementing all aspects of a solution.
Contact a Microsoft-endorsed Regional Director to kick off your project
today.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As you will see <A

and I am really excited to be part of it. </P>
