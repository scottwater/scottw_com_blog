Sometimes, you just have to go with the numbers.

I was recently booking a flight from Philadelphia to Dallas. On the main booking screen USAirways is nice enough to show you the On-Time estimate for each stage of the flight.

If the flight is late more than 50% of the time, maybe it is time to change the flight time.
