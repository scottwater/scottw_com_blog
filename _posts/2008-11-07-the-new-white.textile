Ahh, so many title choices, all of them would have haunted me in Google for many years. Anyway, I recently realized that four of my recent gadget purchases had one thing in common, they were all white.

"iPhone":http://www.apple.com/iphone/ - I went with the white model based on the assumption there would be a lot less noticeable finger prints.&#160; Unfortunately, this does not help the screen when my toddler daughter places it in her mouth.

"Flip Mino":http://www.theflip.com/products_flip_mino.shtml#scene=sceneMain - this one I would have rather had in black, but Amazon charged less for the white version and I did not care enough to pay more. Overall, a killer gadget. You never know when you are going to need to "record an historic event":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHLPa_SdniA.

"Kindle":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scottwater-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FI73MA - no other choice at the moment. Again, the "best device I do not use often enough":http://scottw.com/technology/improving-kindle/.

"Lenovo S10":http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&amp;current-category-id=02695ADDF94544E5A11D24AEBC064493 - There are now other color choices available, but when I got my first netbook white was the only option. So far, this thing has been a pure joy to use. New netbooks seem to be released daily, but at ~$400 there is very little risk. I have also seen the Dell Mini in person which is also impressive. I went with the S10 because it had more disk space. The 16 GB Dell mini wasn't going to cut it for me.
