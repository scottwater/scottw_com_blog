Today's "Easy Things":http://scottw.com/tags/easy-things/ is a new personal bookmarking service called "Instapaper":http://www.instapaper.com/. There really is not much to the service, but it has become a very important tool for me.

Instapaper has one very simple goal: _enable users to easily bookmark a list of articles they would like to read at a later date_. To use the service, you simply click a link on your bookmark toolbar and the article title and link are sent to Instapaper.

Later, when you have some free time, you simply navigate back to Instapaper and you are presented with your list of links.
