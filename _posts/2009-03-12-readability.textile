I was browsing through some recent posts by "Scott Allen":http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/default.aspx, when I came across this "great quote":http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2009/02/11/12522.aspx:

bq.    _...until it's certain that we have a performance problem, it's better to optimize for readability_

Very well said.
