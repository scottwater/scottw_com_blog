bq.  While the self-publishing revolution brought on by blogs was supposed to challenge the push-advertising model as well, it seems that push-advertising will not go down without a fight. I expect that many bloggers will welcome AdBright's new full-page ads.

This blog is not a business, so it is easier for me to say this, but if a blog owners respects their users, they will not use this type of advertising. Blogging is changing the face of media, lets hope we will see the same thing for ads.

I am not against making money via blogging, but IMO, this should not come at the expense of the user experience. These types of ads are horrible.
