  <div class="entry">
     <p>I have been looking for an easy to use library for accessing a restful service which sits behind <span class="caps">NTLM</span> via Ruby for sometime now and had been largely unsuccessful until now!</p>
<p>Last night after a bit more googling, I went back to twitter for help. <a href="http://twitter.com/grantc/status/15222076534">Grant Carpenter</a> put me on the right path with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had the ntlm part working by patching rubyntlm (and then modifying savon). next stop: wsdl impedance <a href="http://bit.ly/982btc">http://bit.ly/982btc</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bitly link above points to a defunct project <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruby-httpclient/">ruby-httpclient</a>. However, it appears to have been reborn as <a href="http://dev.ctor.org/http-access2">httpclient</a> with its source now hosted on <a href="http://github.com/nahi/httpclient">gitub</a>.</p>
<p>Getting a sample up and running could not be easier.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">gem install httpclient

  <div class="entry">
     <p>Yesterday, I made the trip into <span class="caps">NYC</span> to added the <a href="http://www.odata.org/roadshow">OData Roadshow</a>.</p>
<p>For those who have not looked into <a href="http://www.odata.org/">OData</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to unlock your data and free it from silos that exist in applications today. OData does this by applying and building upon Web technologies such as <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) and <span class="caps">JSON</span> to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>I personally do not feel it is truly RESTful, but I am willing to give up some of the tenants of <span class="caps">REST</span> in order to gain consistency.</li>
	<li>While the protocol specification states it is read and write, I would be 99% of implementations will be read only. In fact, in the 5 hours of content covered by Microsoft, there were zero examples of updates.</li>
	<li>If you are using a Linq to &#8220;Your Data Access&#8221; technology adding OData at a high level will be simple. If you are not using one, I expect this as quite a bit of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I really like the concept. Simple conventions for querying and representing data. <span class="caps">IMO</span>, this is the kind of stuff Microsoft should be doing more of (instead of silverlight/windows phone/etc). Couple with their data market (Dallas). I would expect to see much more data becoming available via OData.</p>
<p>On a side note, if the OData Roadshow is coming through your town, I would highly recommend checking it out.</p>
<p>Finally, for a walk through on setting up your own OData service, check out Hanselman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CreatingAnODataAPIForStackOverflowIncludingXMLAndJSONIn30Minutes.aspx">OData For StackOverflow</a> post.</p>

  <h2 id="/dynamics-mongodb-revisited"><a href="/dynamics-mongodb-revisited" rel="bookmark" title="Dynamics and MongoDB Revisited">Dynamics and MongoDB Revisited</a></h2>

  <div class="entry">
     <p>A couple of months ago I wrote about wiring up <a href="http://scottw.com/mongodb-dynamics">C# 4.0 dynamics with MongoDB</a>. At the time, I opened up the <a href="http://github.com/samus/mongodb-csharp">MongoDB-CSharp</a> library and modified a bit of the code.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons this was not a good long term solution. In what appeared to be moment of clarity a couple of days ago, I decided to try to use extension methods and add dynamics on top of MongoDB-CSharp.</p>
<p>To the credit of the MongoDB-CSharp team, getting the basic functionality up and running was very simple. However, in the end it turns out that two compiler hacks (extension methods and dynamics) do not make a right. :)</p>
<p>Once in place, the code to use it looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="csharp"><span class="k">using</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Mongo</span><span class="p">())</span>

    <span class="n">m</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Connect</span><span class="p">();</span>

    <span class="n">m</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Disconnect</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>While it works, it still feels too awkward to be useful <span class="caps">IMO</span>. Normally, this I would just delete something like this, but I am trying to let less code die on my machine, so I published it all as a GitHub gist: <a href="http://gist.github.com/374418">DynoMongo</a>.</p>
<p>After working on this, I have come to the following conclusions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>MongoDB-CSharp provides adequate flexibility on a schema if I need it in .<span class="caps">NET</span>. Mix in Automapper and a helper or two you are all set.</li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/atheken/NoRM">Norm</a> provides more structure if that is a requirementl</li>
	<li>Dynamics are really just a parlor trick. If I want the flexibility of a dynamic language, using C# is a mistake.</li>
	<li>I should probably try to do something similar in IronRuby, but with all the excellent MongoDB Ruby libraries out there, I am not sure it is even worth the thought.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, if someone feels this is interesting or useful, feel free to grab the gist, <a href="http://gist.github.com/374418">DynoMongo</a>, and run with it.</p>

  <h2 id="/seo-rack-rewrite"><a href="/seo-rack-rewrite" rel="bookmark" title="SEO with Rack-Rewrite">SEO with Rack-Rewrite</a></h2>

  <div class="entry">
     <p>I am still very much in the camp of <a href="http://scottw.com/best-seo-advice">write good</a> (and consistent) content first and let <span class="caps">SEO</span> handle itself. However, that does not mean you should not keep an eye out for fundamental problems which can cause bad search engine results.</p>
<p>One of these problems I believe every developer of public web sites needs to be mindful of is duplicate content. Duplicate content causes quite a few problems:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You may appear to be a spammer in the &#8220;eyes&#8221; of a search engine</li>
	<li>Links may appear to be directed at two or more urls</li>
	<li>Your content may have to compete with itself</li>
</ul>
<p>I have long been a fan of <a href="http://scottw.com/tags#sapi-rewrite">ISAPI_Rewrite</a> for <span class="caps">IIS</span> to help manage and control some of these problems (which is in turn heavily influenced by mod_rewrite). However, since I have moved this site to Heroku, I needed to find another solution.</p>
<p>Thankfully, due to the awesomeness of <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a> and middleware, I found a component called <a href="http://github.com/jtrupiano/rack-rewrite">Rack-Rewrite</a> and I was able to leverage it with just a couple of minutes effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A web server agnostic rack middleware for defining and applying rewrite rules. In many cases you can get away with Rack::Rewrite instead of writing Apache mod_rewrite rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am already using a customized Rack application, <a href="http://github.com/bry4n/rack-jekyll">Rack-Jekyll</a>, to power this site, so plugging in Rack-Rewrite was just as simple as adding a couple of lines to my rackup file.</p>
<p>Here are the full contents of my config.ru</p>

</div><p>The two rules I am running on this site ensure that only scottw.com (no www.) is used and that no links end in a &#8220;/&#8221;. The first is particularly important since Heroku issues you a custom url as well.</p>
<p>What is really interesting about Rack-Rewrite is the ability to execute code as part of your rewrites. This enables a lot of flexibility (such as ignoring some rewrites when running in development mode).</p>

  <div class="entry">
     <p>My answer to this question has consistently been, &#8220;<em>Only if you value your time</em>&#8221;.</p>
<p>As an example, I just started watching <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://tekpub.com/preview/iphone">iPhone Development</a> series. There is currently about 2 hours worth of content (and I believe more is on the way). The cost for the series is listed as $25 on the site.</p>
<p>My guess is the videos will save me about 10 to 20 hours of reading, tinkering, and just generally getting things going. Now assuming I put a value of more than $2.50/hr for my time (and i do :), the purchase<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> would be a no brainer.</p>
<p>I also have a subscription to <a href="http://peepcode.com">Peepcode</a> which I have been loving as well.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Disclosure: Rob Conery did comp me a full season pass. However, this came when I was about to personally buy a license so I have no qualms writing this review.</p>
