  <h1>CodeMash 2010</h1>
  <div class="entry">
  	<p>I had the opportunity this year to attend <a href="http://codemash.org/">CodeMash</a> 2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://codemash.org"><img src="http://scottw.com/images/wlw/CodeMash2010_BADB/codemash_bc127d19-e19e-4067-a5ed-bbdc846e2ef6.png" title="codemash logo" alt="codemash logo" /></a></p>
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with CodeMash:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<em>CodeMash is all about jumping into new domains. Getting out of your comfort zone. Learning new things from new people.</em>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CodeMash 2010 was without a doubt the best developer event I have ever attended.</strong></p>
<p>Here is my list about what made it great:</p>
<p>1. People &#8211; there was an awesome mix of people. Those attending seemed to do a really good job of attending sessions there were outside of their comfort zones. I have seen this attempted at other places, but usually the cliques are usually too strong.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.poppendieck.com/">Mary Poppendieck</a> &#8211; her keynote, &#8220;The Five Habits of Successful Lean Development&#8221; was easily worth the price of admission. You can see the <a href="http://www.poppendieck.com/pdfs/Five%20Habits.pdf">slides here</a>. I am considering attending an event or two later this year just to see her speak again.</p>
<p>3. Focus on Craftsmanship &#8211; there were quite a few really good sessions which focused on refining your craft more than just getting to know technology <span class="caps">ABC</span> a little bit better. <a href="http://objo.com/">Joe O&#8217; Brien&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Refactoring the Programmer&#8221; and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/">Jeremy Miller&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Software Design and Testability&#8221; really stood out to me. Both sessions were fabulous and I hope to see Joe and Jeremy present similar sessions at other events this year.</p>
<p>4. Other Technologies &#8211; I have been a fan of <a href="http://mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> for a while. It was great to attend a really good overview session which helped connect a lot dots. I have also had an on again off again fascination with Ruby. It was rewarding to hear some as passionate about as <a href="http://fallenrogue.com/">Leon Gersing</a> walk through some of its&#8217; benefits without the fud.</p>
<p>5. Cost &#8211; I still cannot believe this event only cost $175. It takes a lot of time and effort to put on this kind of event. (Seriously, drop the not-for-profit, double the price, and take this show on the road. It sucks having to wait until next year to attend again :)</p>
<p>6. Family &#8211; I made the newbie mistake of leaving the family home. This is the first developer event I have attended where family (wife &amp; daughter) would have really enjoyed tagging along.</p>
<p>Besides bringing the family, the only thing I would have done differently are the pre-compilers. I skipped them and regretted it. I was trying to minimize time away from home, but I definitely missed out on great sessions.</p>
<p>I am already looking forward to CodeMash 2011 (and please, AT&amp;T get these folks some 3g. Spotty service is one thing, none is just cruel).</p>
